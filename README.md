# HanoiTowers
IOS project which implements the recursive solution for the Hanoi Towers  famous riddle. 
It is something I do when I study a new language and is placed here as a skill demonstrator. 
It offers no input to user and the example currently implement it for 5 rings . Number of rings
is set in a propery (_numOfRings) but no validity checks are done on this number (too large a number
of rings will probably cause display and animation problem.
